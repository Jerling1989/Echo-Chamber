# Echo-Chamber
This is a Social Media Web App I made using a handful of different technologies and coding languages. The website functions much in the same way that many other social media sites like Facebook and Twitter function. A user can create an account, connect with friends, post on their profile, have a newsfeed of posts added by friends, in-app messaging, and many more features. I named it "Echo-Chamber" as a fun tongue-in-cheek jab at modern social media culture.

The specific languages and frameworks I used to build this app are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap.

- The first thing the user will see when going to echo-chamber.us is the login page for the site. If the user has an account they can log into the site, if they do not have an account they can click the link to create a new account and the form will add the neccessary input fields for them to create a new account.
